# Web-Scrapping-Tool-Using-Tkinter
Hi I made this project during the 20 Days in-House Intership Programme on Data Analytics, organized by <b> Department of Computer Science,PIEMR Indore

</b>.

Web scraping is an automated method used to extract large amounts of data from websites. The data on the websites are unstructured. Web scraping helps collect these unstructured data and store it in a structured form.

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:

<li> Python

<li> Tkinter

<li> Web Scrapping

<br> during these 20 days, i learned a lot of about basics of data anlytics and web scrapping.
